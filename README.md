This is my final project for SDEV140. This is currently a work in progress. I used breezypythongui and tkinter to make this program work. The plan for this program is, it's going to be used to help map out a set area
in real-life. Giving set boundaries/areas of what is what. In this case, i'm using for landscaping, I want to use the canvas class in tkinter, to give me something like that. So far,it just draws 4 rectangles, and 
disables/enables them with 2 buttons. I plan on adding a lot more. Making it so you can manipulate not only rectangles, but other shapes. As well as, making it so you can get the maths to get accurate readings 
for the areas/perimeters ect. So, you can use this in real-life and get a good idea of how much of each area is.
